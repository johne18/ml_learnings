Hello - my name is John Santiago, and I'm currently teaching myself Machine Learning. There's not too much here yet, but I am excited to keep learning!

After finishing my statistics book that I had in college, I decided to continue my education through Kaggle, learning Pandas, Data Visualizations and now Machine Learning. 
I'm excited about the path I'm on and hope to create meaningful insights from all kinds of datasets.
