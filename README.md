Hello - my name is John Santiago, and I'm currently teaching myself Machine Learning. There's not too much here yet, but I am excited to keep learning!

After reading my statistics book, I decided to continue my learning through Kaggle familiarizing myself with Pandas, Data Visualizations and now Machine Learning. 
I'm excited about the path I'm on and hope to create meaningful insights from all kinds of datasets.
