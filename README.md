Hello - my name is John Santiago, and I'm currently teaching myself Machine Learning. There's not too much here yet, but I am excited for what awaits me!

After reading my statistics book, I decided to continue my learning journey through Kaggle familiarizing myself with Pandas, Data Visualizations and now Machine Learning. Here you will find jupyter notebooks I made on Kaggle. For each notebook, you can expect the following:
  - The name reflects the name of the dataset I worked on
  - Visualizations and analyses
  - What I've learned and additional analyses

Feel free to message or connect with me on LinkedIn too:
